# YAIM0425 d14b – Minimal Drain Electricity ⚡

## 📦 Description

**YAIM0425 d14b – Minimal Drain Electricity** modifies entities so they **consume only a minimal amount of electricity when inactive**.

The purpose of this MOD is to reduce unnecessary idle power drain, especially in large factories with many machines that are not always working, while keeping normal energy usage when entities are active.

This helps improve power efficiency without changing how machines behave during operation.

## ⚙️ How it works (Player view)

* Entities consume **significantly less electricity** when they are idle
* When an entity becomes active, it consumes energy normally
* No player interaction or configuration is required
* Works automatically once the MOD is enabled

The gameplay flow remains unchanged; only idle energy consumption is reduced.

## ⚠️ Warnings

* 🚨 This MOD **changes energy balance** compared to vanilla gameplay
* 🧪 Recommended for:
  * Large factories
  * Late-game saves
  * Performance and energy-optimization focused playthroughs
* ❌ Not recommended if you want to keep strict vanilla power mechanics
